### Description

This app is a Notes ticket system for a small computer repair shop. The client will be able to manage and assign tasks to employees, authenticate and save tasks on a reliable database. The app will also include features that will only be available to admin users that make it easier to manage tasks, clients and employees with a simple ui and easy navigation to increase workflow. Each employee will be able to login create tasks when attending to a client or view tasks assigned to them by the admin or manager. Only relevant tasks will be displayed to each employee which they can update based on completion but only admin users can delete tasks. Deployed project

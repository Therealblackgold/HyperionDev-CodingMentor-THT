- https://edabit.com/challenge/4E9gTrRWErpTCA2FQ

  To run the program

## Install node modules

`npm install`

### JEST is used for running unit tests

`npm test`

### run js script

`node sayNumber.js`

### Space/Time complexity

The time complexity of this function is O(n), where n is the length of the number.
This is because the function needs to loop through the individual digits of the number and
perform string manipulation operations, which take linear time. The numToWord function also
takes linear time, so the overall time complexity of the function is O(n).

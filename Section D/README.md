## Section D: Mentorship Option 3: Student Feedback

---

As a mentor, it's important to handle this situation in a
professional and respectful manner. The first plan of action would be to start by acknowledging the student's concerns and apologizing for any confusion or frustration the feedback may have caused, clarify the feedback by explaining to the student that my feedback was meant to be constructive.

If the student has made a complaint on social media, try to reach out to them in a private message to address the issue. Explain my perspective and offer to discuss their concerns further in a one-on-one meeting.

Try to find a solution that works for both parties. If the student is willing to discuss their concerns in a one-on-one meeting, using the opportunity to listen to their perspective and come up with a plan of action that addresses their needs.

It's important to maintain a professional demeanor and avoid getting defensive or reacting emotionally, even if the student is being unreasonable. This will help to de-escalate the situation and find a resolution that is satisfactory for both parties involved.

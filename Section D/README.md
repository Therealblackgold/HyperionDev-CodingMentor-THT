### Option 1: Student Progress

Assessing reasons why students are falling behind starting by having individual meetings with the 5 students who are 2 weeks behind to understand the reasons behind them falling behind. Are they facing technical difficulties, personal issues, or do they need additional support in a specific area?

Develop a plan of action based on the assessments, develop a personalized plan of action for each student that addresses their individual needs. This could include extra one-on-one time, additional resources, or a modified timeline for completing the bootcamp.

Prioritize the at-risk students who are at risk of falling behind should be given priority attention. Work with them to help them complete their next task and provide any support they need to catch up.

Foster collaboration encourage the 5 students who are ahead to share their knowledge and experience with the other students, both lagging and at-risk. This can help build a supportive community and prevent the 5 ahead students from becoming negatively impacted.

Monitor progress regularly with regular check-ins with each student can help you monitor their progress and identify any roadblocks early on. This will also help adjust my plan of action as needed to ensure that all students are on track.

### Option 3: Student Feedback

As a mentor, it's important to handle this situation in a
professional and respectful manner. The first plan of action would be to start by acknowledging the student's concerns and apologizing for any confusion or frustration the feedback may have caused, clarify the feedback by explaining to the student that my feedback was meant to be constructive.

If the student has made a complaint on social media, try to reach out to them in a private message to address the issue. Explain my perspective and offer to discuss their concerns further in a one-on-one meeting.

Try to find a solution that works for both parties. If the student is willing to discuss their concerns in a one-on-one meeting, using the opportunity to listen to their perspective and come up with a plan of action that addresses their needs.

It's important to maintain a professional demeanor and avoid getting defensive or reacting emotionally, even if the student is being unreasonable. This will help to de-escalate the situation and find a resolution that is satisfactory for both parties involved.
